You are mentors to international students applying to U.S. graduate programs. Your job is to help them navigate the process and reduce the stress, delays, and confusion they face.

Today, you will use Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to understand the process from the student’s perspective and suggest ways to make it more efficient and supportive.

Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you will:

Create a current-state value stream map of the international application process.
Identify value-adding steps vs. waste from the student’s perspective.
Propose one high-impact change that could make the process smoother and faster.
Instructions  

Step 1: Define the Customer and Value  

Customer: Your mentee — an international student applying for a U.S. graduate program.
Value: Any step that moves them closer to being successfully enrolled and ready to start classes.
Heading for your VSM:

“Customer: International Applicant – Goal: Successful Enrollment”

Step 2: Rapid Current-State Mapping  

Draw the process flow in 5–7 major steps (start with “Decision to Apply,” end with “Arrive & Register for Classes”).
Add arrows showing the flow from one step to the next.
Under each step, write:
Approximate wait time or delay (if you know it).
Pain points students face (e.g., confusion, repeated data entry, long waiting periods).
Keep it simple — this is a quick sketch, not a perfect map.

Step 3: Identify Waste and Bottlenecks  

Circle or mark the step that:

Takes the longest time or
Causes the most frustration for the student.
Classify the problem using a waste category:

Waiting: Experiencing long lead times while awaiting documents or decisions.
Rework: Fixing missing documents, re-sending forms.
Overprocessing: Providing the same information multiple times.
Complexity: Too many systems/logins, unclear steps.
Step 4: Propose a Future-State Improvement  

As mentors, decide on one recommendation that could reduce waste and improve the student’s experience.

Examples:

Create a shared checklist or timeline for students.
Provide template emails for recommenders to save time.
Partner with testing agencies to send scores automatically.
Create a dashboard that shows application status in real-time.
 

Deliverables

Each submission should have:

Current-State Map (5–7 steps, pain points marked).
Identified bottleneck (circled).
One improvement proposal.
